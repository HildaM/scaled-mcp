This is a library module, please follow go best practices for libraries.

There are 3 libraries here - scaled-mcp-server, which is a horizontally scalable mcp server, scaled-mcp-client which is a 2025 spec compatible client with options, and mcp-http-test-harness which is a tester designed exclusively for testing mcp servers (of either 2024 or 2025-03 specs)

Please only use slog for logging.

Please check in all the appropriate places BEFORE implementing an interface. Only implement interfaces if you're 100% sure they don't exist.

If you have an interface - don't ever create an adapter interface to simply wrap it, instead, pass that interface around.
